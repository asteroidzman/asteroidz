# amsg(1) - User Manual

`amsg` is the command-line interface for asteroidz's Inter-Process Communication (IPC) system. It allows users and scripts to query the state of the compositor or subscribe to real-time events.

## SYNOPSIS
`amsg <command> [arguments...]`

## DESCRIPTION
`amsg` acts as a client that connects to the asteroidz compositor via a Unix domain socket defined by the `ASTEROIDZ_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE` environment variable. It supports two primary modes of operation:
1. **One-shot Request (`get`)**: Sends a query to the compositor, receives a single JSON response, and terminates.
2. **Persistent Stream (`watch`)**: Subscribes to a specific state, receiving continuous JSON updates whenever that state changes.

## ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
* **`ASTEROIDZ_INSTANCE_SIGNATURE`**: Must be set to the path of the Unix socket created by the running asteroidz instance. This is typically handled automatically when running `amsg` from within a terminal spawned by the compositor.

## COMMANDS

### GET (One-Shot Queries)
| Command | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `get version` | Returns the current version of the compositor. |
| `get cursorpos` | Returns the global pointer position (`x`, `y`) and the monitor under it. |
| `get keymode` | Returns the current active keyboard mode (e.g., normal, insert). |
| `get keyboardlayout` | Returns the active XKB layout (abbreviated). |
| `get monitor <name>` | Returns full JSON details for a specific monitor. |
| `get focused-client` | Returns full JSON details for the client currently in focus. |
| `get client <id>` | Returns full JSON details for a client with the given ID. |
| `get tag <mon> <idx>` | Queries status of a specific tag on a monitor. |
| `get tags <mon>` | Returns a JSON object containing the status of all tags on a monitor. |
| `get all-clients` | Returns a JSON array of all active clients. |
| `get all-monitors` | Returns a JSON array of all connected monitors. |
| `get all-tags` | Returns a JSON object containing the status of all tags. |
| `get last_open_surface [<mon>]` | Returns the last focused surface name for a monitor,if the mon not set, it will get current monitor. |
| `get bar-config` | Returns the resolved bar geometry, palette and module lists, for an out-of-process bar. |

*Example:*
```bash
amsg get monitor eDP-1
amsg get all-clients
amsg get all-monitors
amsg get cursorpos
```

### WATCH (Event Subscription)
Subscribes the client to real-time updates. When the state changes, the server pushes a new JSON object to the output stream.

* `watch monitor <name>`
* `watch focused-client`
* `watch client <id>`
* `watch tags <mon_name>`
* `watch all-monitors`
* `watch all-tags`
* `watch all-clients`
* `watch keymode`
* `watch keyboardlayout`
* `watch last_open_surface [<mon_name>]`
* `watch bar-config`

*Example:*
```bash
# watch all monitors
amsg watch all-monitors
# watch all tags
amsg watch all-tags
```

#### bar-config, for a bar that is not the compositor

`bar-config` answers with what the compositor **resolved** -- after defaults,
after clamping, after the theme file -- rather than with the config text:

```json
{
  "bar":     { "height": 48, "position": "top", "margin_x": 8, ... },
  "panel":   { "enable": true, "radius": 9, "blur": true, "color": [...] },
  "popover": { "width": 340, "row_height": 34, ... },
  "theme":   { "fg": [1,1,1,1], "focus_bg": [...], "font": "Ubuntu 16", ... },
  "custom":  [ { "name": "tray", "exec": "asteroidz-trayd", ... } ]
}
```

Colours are `[r,g,b,a]` floats, not hex strings: CSS reads `#RRGGBBAA` and Qt
reads `#AARRGGBB`, and a string that parses under both conventions while
meaning different things is a bug that surfaces months later as "the bar is
slightly the wrong colour".

Handing a bar the config file to parse instead would be two KDL readers that
agree until one of them gains a default -- and it would still not see the
palette, which matugen rewrites at runtime whenever the wallpaper changes. The
compositor is the only process that knows what the theme currently *is*.

`watch bar-config` pushes the same object again on every `reload_config`, so a
bar in another process repaints with the new palette instead of waiting for
something else to wake it.

#### Output configuration

| Dispatch | Effect |
| :--- | :--- |
| `set_output_mode,<output>,<WxH[@Hz]>` | Pick a mode the output actually reports. |
| `set_output_scale,<output>,<scale>` | Fractional scales included. |
| `set_output_position,<output>,<x>,<y>` | Move it in the layout, live. |
| `set_output_vrr,<output>,<0\|1>` | Adaptive sync. |
| `set_output_icc,<output>,<path>` | ICC profile for SDR output; empty clears it. |

Every one names its output rather than acting on the focused one: a dispatch
has no pointer context, and guessing would make the same command do different
things depending on where the mouse happened to be.

Mode and scale are **tested before they are committed** (`wlr_output_test_state`),
and a rejected commit starts a retrain -- a picker must not be able to black
out a display. A mode that the output does not advertise is refused rather than
synthesised.

### DISPATCH
Allows sending commands to the compositor to alter its state.
* `dispatch <func_name>,[args...] [client,<id>]`

*Example:* 
```bash   
# operate specific client by id
amsg dispatch exchange_client,left client,375
# operate current client
amsg dispatch exchange_client,left
````
